# H5P Interactive 360 Video

Create interactive 360° videos with text, tasks and other media placed in spherical space.

## About

This project is a derivative work based on [H5P Interactive Video](https://github.com/h5p/h5p-interactive-video), originally developed by Joubel AS. It has been modified and extended to support 360° video playback with interactions positioned in 3D spherical space using yaw/pitch coordinates.

This work has been developed by Veljko Markovic (Oct. 2025-Jan. 2026) in his Bachelor thesis of Computer Science at University of Applied Sciences and Arts (SUPSI, Lugano CH) as partial fulfillment of the Bachelor degree. The work has been committed and directed by Prof. Lorenzo Sommaruga (SUPSI-DTI), the supervisor.

## Acknowledgements

**Initial prototype development:**
The initial concept and prototype for this project was started by Jonathan Casadei (2025) as part of a previous bachelor thesis project. While the current implementation is a complete rewrite based on H5P Interactive Video, we acknowledge his initial development work.
